# Motivation  

The question of interest is the relationship between 
health expenditure and life expectancy. More specifically,
the quesiton are   

1. Is there a relationship between healthcare coverage and healthcare spending in the United States?   
2. Which US states spend the most and which spend the least on healthcare? How does the spending distribution change across geographic regions in the Unied States?

## Healthcare data

We will be using the data from the [Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF)](https://www.kff.org). 

* [Health Insurance Coverage of the Total Population](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/) - Includes years 2013-2016
* [Health Care Expenditures by State of Residence (in millions)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/health-care-expenditures-by-state-of-residence-in-millions/) - Includes years 1991-2014
 
We have downloaded, re-named and saved these files in our course 
GitHub repository under the `data/KFF/` directory. 

Now, before we dig into the data analysis, we need to introduce 
a set of R packages that we will use to analyze the data. 

## Welcome to the "Tidyverse"

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is _"an opinionated 
collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages 
share an underlying philosophy and common APIs."_ 

Another way of putting it is that it's a set of packages 
that are useful specifically for data manipulation, 
exploration and visualization with a common philosphy. 

### What is this common philosphy? 

The common philosphy is called _"tidy"_ data. It is 
a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset
to its structure.

In _tidy_ data:

* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-1.png")
```

Below, we are interested in transformating the table on 
the right to the the table on the left, which is 
considered "tidy". 

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-9.png")
```

Working with tidy data is useful because it creates a structured way of
organizing data values within a data set. This makes the data analysis 
process more efficient and simplifies the development of data analysis tools
that work together. In this way, you can focus on the problem you are
investigating, rather than the uninteresting logistics of data.  

### What is in the `tidyverse`? 

We can install and load the set of R packages using 
`install.packages("tidyverse")` function. 

When we load the tidyverse package using `library(tidyverse)`, 
there are six core R packages that load:

* [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org), for data import.
* [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org), for data tidying.
* [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org), for data wrangling.
* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), for data visualisation.
* [purrr](http://purrr.tidyverse.org), for functional programming.
* [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org), for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames.

Here, we load in the tidyverse. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

These packages are highlighted in bold here: 

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2017-06-09-What-is-the-tidyverse_files/tidyverse1.png")
```

Because these packages all share the "tidy" philosphy, 
the data analysis workflow is easier as you move from 
package to package. 

Here, we will focus on the `readr`,
`tidyr` and `dplyr` R packages to import data, 
to transform data to the "tidy" format, 
and to wrangle data. 

Next, we will give a brief description of the 
features in each of these packages. 

# Data Import

There are several base R functions that allow you 
read in data into R, which you may be familiar 
with such as `read.table()`, `read.csv()`, 
and `read.delim()`. Instead of using these, 
we will use the functions in the 
[readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/articles/readr.html)
R package. The main reasons for this are 

1. Compared to equivalent base R functions, the 
functions in `readr` are around 10x faser. 
2. You can specify the column types (e.g 
character, integer, double, logical, date, 
time, etc)
3. All parsing problems are recordered in 
a data frame. 

## The `readr` R package

The main functions in `readr` are: 

`readr` functions | Description
--- | ---
`read_delim()` | reads in a flat file data with a given character to separate fields
`read_csv()` | reads in a CSV file
`read_tsv()` | reads in a file with values separated by tabs
`read_lines()` | reads only a certain number of lines from the file
`read_file()` | reads a complete file into a string
`write_csv()` | writes data frame to CSV 

A useful cheatsheet for the functions in the
`readr` package can be found on RStudio's website: 

![](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/data-import.png)


## Read in healthcare coverage data

Let's try reading in some data. We will begin by
reading in the `healthcare-coverage.csv` data. 

If we want to see what the header of the file looks like, 
we can use the `read_lines()` function to peak at the 
first few lines. 

```{r}
read_lines(file = "./data/KFF/healthcare-coverage.csv", n_max = 10)
```

It looks like the first two lines are descriptive 
and are not useful. We will tell R to skip reading 
these in using the `skip` argument in 
`read_csv()`. The third line looks like it contains the
column names and starting on the fourth line is
where the data starts. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
coverage <- read_csv("./data/KFF/healthcare-coverage.csv", 
                     skip = 2, col_names = TRUE)
head(coverage)
tail(coverage)
```

It looks like we now have the right header, but
there are a bunch of NAs in the end of the data 
frame because most of it isn't useful data. 

Let's take a closer look at the last 30 lines
```{r}
tail(coverage, n=30)
```

It looks like there is a line with a string 
`Notes` in it and everything below that line
should not be read in. We can use the `n_max` 
argument here.

```{r, message=FALSE}
coverage <- read_csv("./data/KFF/healthcare-coverage.csv", 
                     skip = 2, col_names = TRUE)
coverage <- read_csv("./data/KFF/healthcare-coverage.csv", 
                     skip = 2, col_names = TRUE,
                     n_max  = which(coverage$Location == "Notes")-1)
tail(coverage)
```

That's better! 

### Read in healthcare spending data

Now because we are also going to want to 
use in `healthcare-spending.csv`, let's 
read it in now. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
spending <- read_csv("./data/KFF/healthcare-spending.csv", 
                     skip = 2, col_names = TRUE)
spending <- read_csv("./data/KFF/healthcare-spending.csv", 
                     skip = 2, col_names = TRUE,
                     n_max  = which(spending$Location == "Notes")-1)
tail(spending)
```


## Take a `glimpse()` at your data

One last thing in this section. 
One way to look at our data would be to use 
`head()` or `tail()`, as we just saw. 
Another one you might have heard of is the
`str()` function. One you might not have 
heard of is the `glimpse()` function. It's
used for a special type of object in R called 
a `tibble`. Let's read the help file to learn
more. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?tibble::tibble
```

It's kind of like `print()` where it shows you 
columns running down the page. Let's try it out. 
If we look at our data, say the `coverage` 
data frame, we see that it is not _"tidy"_: 
```{r}
glimpse(coverage)
```


## Data Tidying

A subset of the data analysis process can be thought
about in the following way:

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science.png")
```

where each of these steps need their own 
tools and software to complete. 

After we import the data into R, if we are 
going to take advantage of the _"tidyverse"_, 
this means we need to _transform_ the data 
into a form that is _"tidy"_. If you recall, 
in _tidy_ data:

* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

For example, consider the following dataset: 

![](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2016/raw/master/lectures/wrangling/pics/stocks-by-company.png)

Here:  

* each row represents one company (row names are companies)
* each column represent one time point
* the stock prices are defined for each row/column pair

Alternatively, a data set can be structured in the following way:

* each row represents one time point (but no row names)
* the first column defines the time variable and the last three columns contain the stock prices for three companies 

![](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2016/raw/master/lectures/wrangling/pics/stocks-by-time.png)

In both cases, the data is the same, but the structure is 
different. This can be  _frustrating_ to deal with as an 
analyst because the meaning of the values (rows and columns)
in the two data sets are different. Providing a standardized 
way of organizing values within a data set would alleviate 
a major portion of this frustration.  

For motivation, a _tidy_ version of the stock data we 
looked at above looks like this: (we'll learn how the
functions work in just a moment)

![](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2016/raw/master/lectures/wrangling/pics/stocks-tidy.png)

In this "tidy" data set, we have three columns representing 
three variables (time, company name and stock price). 
Every row represents contains one stock price from a 
particular time and for a specific company. 

If we consider our `coverage` dataframe, we see it 
is also not in a tidy format. Each row contains information
about the coverage level by `Location` across years and 
types of coverage. 

```{r}
coverage[1:5, 1:5]
```

Now, let's use the `tidyr` R package to transform
our data into a _tidy_ format. 

## The `tidyr` R package

[`tidyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)
is an R package that transforms data sets to a tidy format. 

This package is installed and loaded when you load 
the `tidyverse` using `library(tidyverse)`. However, 
you can also just load the library by itself. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
```

The main functions in `tidyr` are: 

`tidyr` functions | Description
------- | -------
`gather()` | takes multiple columns, and gathers them into key-value pairs, making "wide" data longer
`separate()` | turns a single character column into multiple columns, making "long" data wider

We'll explore what it means to go between a "wide" and "long" 
data format using `gather()` and `separate()` next. 

A [`tidyr` cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
for the functions in the `tidyr` package can be 
found on RStudio's website: 

### Convert healthcare coverage data to a tidy format

Let's start by looking at the `gather()` help file

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?gather
```

This function gathers multiple columns and collapses them into new 
*key-value* pairs. This transform data from _wide_ format into 
a _long_  format. 

* The `key` is the name of the _new_ column that you are creating which 
contains the values of the column headings that you are gathering 
* The `value` is the name of the _new_ column that will contain the values
themselves
* The third argument defines the columns to gather

For example, here we create a column titled 
`year_type` and `coverage`. We also want to keep 
the `Location` column as it is because it also contains
observational level data.

```{r}
coverage <- gather(coverage, "year_type", "tot_coverage", -Location)
coverage
```

Now we see each row contains one observation. 
Namely, a `Location`, a `year_type` and `coverage`. 
It would be nice to separate out the information 
in the `year_type` column into two columns. We will 
explore how to do that in the Data Wrangling section
below. For now let's learn more about the `tidyr` 
package. 

#### Convert back to a wide format

In contrast to *gathering* multiple columns into key-value pairs, we can 
*spread* a key-value pair across multiple columns.  

The function `spread()` does just that. It transforms data from a _long_
format into a _wide_ format. 

* The `key` is the name of the column in your data set that 
contains the values of the column headings that you are spreading across 
multiple columns
* The `value` is the name of the column that contains the values for the 
multiple columns


```{r}
spread(coverage, year_type, tot_coverage)
```

### Convert healthcare spending data to a tidy format

Let's do the same for the `spending` data. In this 
case I will use `year` and `spending` for
the `key` and `value`. We also want to keep `Location`
like before. 

```{r}
spending <- gather(spending, "year", "tot_spending", -Location)
spending
```

# Data Wrangling

In the real world, analyzing data rarely involves 
data that can be easily imported and ready for 
analysis. According to Wikipedia:

> Data munging or data wrangling is loosely the process 
of manually converting or mapping data from one "raw" 
form into another format that allows for more convenient 
consumption of the data with the help of semi-automated 
tools.

As you will see in class, one of the most 
time-consuming aspects of the data analysis 
process is "data wrangling". This is also 
is a trendy term for 
_cleaning up a messy data set_. 

R provides incredibly powerful and flexible language 
for data wrangling. However, the syntax is somewhat 
hard to get used to. We will therefore introducing 
a package that makes the syntax much more like 
the English language. This package is `dplyr`. 

### The `dplyr` R package

[`dplyr`](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) 
is a powerful R-package to transform and summarize 
tabular data with rows and columns. 

The package contains a set of functions 
(or "verbs") to perform common data manipulation
operations such as filtering for rows, selecting 
specific columns, re-ordering rows, adding new 
columns and summarizing data. 

In addition, `dplyr` contains a useful function to
perform another common task which is the is the 
"split-apply-combine" concept.  We will discuss 
that in a little bit. 

#### How does it compare to using base functions R?

If you are familiar with R, you are probably familiar 
with base R functions such as `split()`, `subset()`, 
`apply()`, `sapply()`, `lapply()`, `tapply()` and 
`aggregate()`. Compared to base functions in R, the 
functions in `dplyr` are easier to work with, are 
more consistent in the syntax and are targeted for 
data analysis around data frames instead of just vectors. 

The important `dplyr` verbs to remember are: 

`dplyr` verbs | Description
--- | ---
`select()` | select columns 
`filter()` | filter rows
`arrange()` | re-order or arrange rows
`mutate()` | create new columns
`summarize()` | summarize values
`group_by()` | allows for group operations in the "split-apply-combine" concept



#### Pipe operator: %>%

Before we go any futher, let's introduce the 
pipe operator: `%>%`. In our `stocks` example,
we briefly saw this symbol. It is called the
pipe operator. `dplyr` imports
this operator from another package 
(`magrittr`)
[see help file here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html). 
This operator allows you to pipe the output 
from one function to the input of another
function. Instead of nesting functions 
(reading from the inside to the 
outside), the idea of of piping is to 
read the functions from left to right. 

Now in `stocks` example, we pipe the `stocks`
data frame to the function that will 
gather multiple columns into key-value pairs. 

![](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2016/raw/master/lectures/wrangling/pics/stocks-tidy.png)


### `dplyr` verbs in action

First, let's separate the `year_type` column 
in the `coverage` dataset to two columns:
`year` and health coverage `type`. 

To do this, we will use the `separate()` 
function in the `tidyr` package. 

**Note**: 

* `separate()` = separate one column into multiple columns
* `unite()` = unite multiple columns into one


```{r}
coverage %>% 
  separate(year_type, sep="__", 
           into=c("year", "type"))
```

We see that we now have two columns, except 
the `year` column was converted to a character. 
If we look at the help file `?separate`, we see
we can use the `convert=TRUE` argument to 
convert the character to an integer. 

```{r}
coverage <- 
  coverage %>% 
  separate(year_type, sep="__", 
           into=c("year", "type"), 
           convert = TRUE)
coverage
```

Next, we see that the `tot_coverage` column is 
also a character. Gah! 

Let's fix that. We can use the `mutate_at()` 
function to do this. We are asking R to take
`tot_coverage` column and convert it to an
integer and then replace the old column with 
the new converted column 

```{r}
coverage <- 
  coverage %>% 
  mutate_at("tot_coverage", as.integer)
```

The `coverage` data looks good now. We see 
that there are different `year`s and different 
`types` of healthcare coverage. 

#### Excercise 

What is the range of years and types of healthcare
in the `coverage` dataset? 

```{r}
## add your code here

table(coverage$type, coverage$year)
```


Next, we will look at the `spending` data. 
We see the `year` column has information that 
we do not want. We only care about the year. 

```{r}
spending
```

Let's use the `separate()` function with `convert=TRUE` 
to separate the `year` column into columns. Then, we 
introduce another `dplyr` action verb: `select()`. 

The two most basic functions are `select()` and 
`filter()` which selects columns and filters 
rows, respectively. 

##### Selecting columns using `select()`

In the `separate()` function, we create two
new columns called `year` and `name`. Then, 
we ask to return all the columns, except 
`name`. To select all the columns *except* a 
specific column, use the "-" (subtraction) operator 
(also known as negative indexing). 

```{r}
spending <- 
  spending %>% 
  separate(year, sep="__", into=c("year", "name"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  select(-name)
spending
```

The function `select()` is much more 
powerful though. To select a range 
of columns by name, use the ":" (colon) operator

```{r}
coverage %>% 
  select(year:type)
```

To select all columns that start with the 
character string "t", use the function `starts_with()`

```{r}
coverage %>% 
  select(starts_with("t"))
```

Some additional options to select columns based 
on a specific criteria include

1. `ends_with()` = Select columns that end with 
a character string
2. `contains()` = Select columns that contain 
a character string
3. `matches()` = Select columns that match a 
regular expression
4. `one_of()` = Select columns names that are 
from a group of names


##### Selecting rows using `filter()`

Let's say we want to know how many peopled 
had health insurance coverage in Maryland? 

First, we can filter the rows for years in 2007. 

```{r}
coverage %>% 
  filter(Location == "Maryland")
```

**Note**: you can use the boolean operators 
(e.g. `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, `%in%`) 
to create logical tests.

For example, if we wanted only years 
after 2014, we can add a second criteria: 

```{r}
coverage %>% 
  filter(Location == "Maryland", 
         year > 2014)
```

##### Excercise 

Has the number of uninsured has
increased or decreased in Maryland 
between 2013 and 2016? 

```{r}
## add your code here

coverage %>% 
  filter(Location == "Maryland", 
         type == "Uninsured")
```

What happened between 2013 and 2014? 
[Hint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act)

##### Arrange or re-order rows using `arrange()`

Now, let's say we want to see which states has the To arrange (or re-order) rows by a particular 
column such as the population, list the name of 
the column you want to arrange the rows by

```{r}
coverage %>% 
    arrange(tot_coverage)
```


##### Exercise 

In 2016, what were the top three states with 
the largest `Employer` type of healthcare 
coverage? 

**Hint**: use the `desc()` function inside of
`arrange()` to order rows in a descending order. 

```{r}
## add your code here

coverage %>% 
  filter(Location != "United States", year == 2016, type == "Employer") %>% 
  arrange(desc(tot_coverage)) %>% 
  head(n=3)
```


# Data import
Show data downloading.   


Q4: Should "data downloading" proceess be showed in "What is the 
data?" or "Data import?" ? If it is "Data import," what does  
"What is the data" mean? 

 
# Data wrangling 
* Introducing readr function    
- Mention "read_csv" is faster than "read.csv"   
  
Q5: Should we do introduce some nuance between them? (
ex: use `Sys.time()` function to demonstrate? )           

- similar issue: `load` versus `library`    
* Introducing tidy verse function    
    
# Exploratory data analysis 
Exploratory plots   
Q6: How many exporatory plots should be enough? (
No exact number, but do we have a range?)  

# Data analysis    
Q7: Should we skip this in this project? If not, 
what would you like to do? (Concerns: we many not have
other variables if we want to do modeling)  
   
# Summary of results
- Interpretation is based on the exlporatory analysis?            
- Limitations   
(1) Meaning of life expectancy   
(2) What does health expenditure stand for?   
(3) Health expenditure = quality of care?     
(4) Health expenditure = poor choice of medical care package?   
(5) Health expenditure = proxy for SES?   
(6) Potential ecological fallacy?        
...
